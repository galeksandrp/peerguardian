# Short-Description: MoBlock initscript
# Description:       An IP blocker for Linux
#	MoBlock blocks connections from/to hosts listed in a very large
#	blocklist.
#	The blocklist can be in one of the following formats: eMule 
#       "ipfilter.dat", "peerguardian .p2p text" or "peerguardian .p2b v2
#       binary".
#       This package uses the xt_NFQUEUE kernel module (available since kernel
#       >=2.6.13).
