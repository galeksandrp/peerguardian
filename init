# Short-Description: IP block daemon initscript
# Description:       An IP blocker for Linux
#    MoBlock blocks connections from/to hosts listed in a very large blocklist.
#    The blocklist can be in one of the following formats: eMule "ipfilter.dat",

#    This package uses the xt_NFQUEUE kernel module (available since kernel
#    >=2.6.13).
