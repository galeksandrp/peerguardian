# blockcontrol.conf - configuration file for blockcontrol

# This file is sourced by a shell script. Any line which starts with a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. If you set the same variable several times,
# then only the last line will be used. You have to stop and restart moblock
# if you change entries.

# Values from this file (blockcontrol.conf) will be overwritten by default
# (/etc/default/blockcontrol) if they are set there.
# THE DEBIAN (AND UBUNTU) PACKAGE CONFIGURATION SYSTEM DEBCONF AND THE
# GRAPHICAL INTERFACE MOBLOQUER STORE THE CONFIGURATION IN MOBLOCK.DEFAULT.
# It is strongly recommended that you make your changes in this file, too.

############################ General configuration ############################

# The name of the application (moblock or nfblock), the path to it and its
# description. This is set automatically, so you should not need to set them.
# If you experience problems set them here. Never set NAME in default
# because most paths are set depending on the NAME variable before
# default is loaded.
#NAME="moblock"
#DAEMON="/usr/bin/$NAME"
#DESC="MoBlock"

# Set the format of the blocklists that you use. All your blocklists have to be
# in this format.
# d - eMule ipfilter.dat format
#     Example line:
#     001.000.000.000 , 001.255.255.255 , 100 , Some organization
# n - PeerGuardian .p2b v2 binary format
# p - PeerGuardian .p2p text format (default)
#     Example line:
#     Some organization:1.0.0.0-1.255.255.255
BLOCKLIST_FORMAT="p"

# Turn on/off automatic start
# Note: this tells the MoBlock init script from starting on "start". Therefore
# MoBlock will not be started at system boot. The same behaviour can be achieved
# by removing/tweaking the init file and the links pointing to it. You can do
# this manually or by using an application such as rcconf.
# 0 - Don't start MoBlock at system boot
# 1 - Start MoBlock at system boot (default)
# 2 - Quickstart MoBlock at system boot (Start MoBlock without rebuilding the
#     blocklist, so changes to the blocklist will not take effect until the next
#     reload or update).
INIT="1"

# Turn on/off automatic blocklist update
# 0 - Don't update the blocklists automatically
# 1 - Update the blocklists automatically (default)
CRON="1"

# You may specify additional options for wget for the blocklist download here.
# Note: In this variable the download application (wget) must be contained! Some
# options are hardcoded in blockcontrol.lib and so are not changeable here.
# The default options make sure that blockcontrol plays nice with the list
# servers.
# For example you may specify a proxy:
# WGET_OPTS="http_proxy=URL wget -q -t 5 -T 120 -w 5"
WGET_OPTS="wget -q -t 5 -T 120 -w 5"

################## Settings for the iptables firewall rules ###################

# MoBlock checks traffic in userspace. Iptables rules decide which traffic gets
# there.

# Do a "blockcontrol stop" before you change these iptables settings and a
# "blockcontrol start" afterwards.

# The old variable IPTABLES_MODULES is obsolete since blockcontrol
# 0.9~rc2-17. Now it is checked automatically if kernel modules need to be
# loaded.

# Set the iptables target for sending traffic to userspace.
# NFQUEUE - available since kernel version 2.6.13 (default)
# QUEUE   - (deprecated, you have to edit the Makefile and recompile MoBlock to
#           use this)
IPTABLES_TARGET="NFQUEUE"

# Set the NFQUEUE queue number.
# Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 92.
NFQUEUE_NUMBER="92"

# Set how traffic is sent to MoBlock
# 0 - Don't set any iptables rules.
#     You or another script/firewall has to do this!
# 1 - Place MoBlock's iptables rules in separate iptables chains (blockcontrol_in,
#     blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw). (default)
# 2 - Only set custom iptables rules (/etc/blockcontrol/iptables-custom-insert.sh
#     and iptables-custom-remove.sh)
IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1"

# Activate MoBlock's iptables chains?
# This section works only for IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1"
# 0 - Do nothing. You or another script/firewall has to do this!
# 1 - Send all NEW traffic to MoBlock's iptables chains (blockcontrol_in,
#     blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw). These iptables rules are inserted at the head
#     of the chains INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD. It is absolutely safe to only
#     check NEW traffic. (default)
# 2 - Send all traffic to MoBlock's iptables chains (blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and
#     blockcontrol_fw). These iptables rules are inserted at the head of the chains
#     INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD. Checking all (not only NEW) traffic might cause
#     problems because MoBlock has to check much more traffic then. Further
#     whitelisting gets more complicated, since you have to think of both
#     directions, incoming and outgoing. Only do this, if you are sure that you
#     want to.
IPTABLES_ACTIVATION="1"

# Set what happens to matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets.
# 0 - DROP them directly (as in MoBlock 0.8).
# 1 - MARK them. Further iptables rules decide what happens to them. E.g. this
#     allows to REJECT packets to avoid the long timeout which occurs when
#     packets are DROPped, see below. This setting is also necessary for
#     iptables logging to syslog, see above. (default)
REJECT="1"

# Set the corresponding MARK
REJECT_MARK="10"

# Set the iptables target for "marked block" packets.
# This section works only for IPTABLES_ACTIVATION="1"
# REJECT_IN is useless for the unpatched MoBlock source (0.8 and 0.9RC2), since
# there matched incoming packets are dropped directly. So the DROP rule in
# the iptables chain blockcontrol_in will never be met.
# Valid values are all iptables targets. Be careful: senseless values are also
# accepted.
# REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
# DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
REJECT_IN="DROP"
REJECT_OUT="REJECT"
REJECT_FW="DROP"

# Set what happens to non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets.
# 0 - ACCEPT them directly (as in MoBlock 0.8)
# 1 - MARK them. MoBlock will then ignore them. This allows integration with
#     other firewalls. (default)
ACCEPT="1"

# Set the corresponding MARK
ACCEPT_MARK="20"

# Set the iptables target for whitelisting packets.
# Valid values are all iptables targets. Be careful: senseless values are also
# accepted.
# ACCEPT: The packets are accepted directly.
# RETURN: Further iptables rules decide what happens to the packets. MoBlock
# will ignore them. This allows integration with other firewalls. (default)
IPTABLES_TARGET_WHITELISTING="RETURN"

# Whitelist local traffic
# 0 - Do nothing.
# 1 - Automatically whitelist LAN traffic and traffic on the loopback device.
#     (default)
# 2 - Whitelist the loopback device (same as obsolete setting LOOPBACK="1").
WHITE_LOCAL="1"

############################### Whitelist ports ###############################

# Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
# ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
# specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
# Seperate several entries with whitespace (" "). Be careful: senseless values
# are also accepted.
#
# Common ports:
#   80 - http
#  443 - https
#   22 - ssh
#  993 - SSL IMAP
# This section works only for IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1"
# Do a "blockcontrol restart" when you have changed these settings.

WHITE_TCP_IN=""
WHITE_UDP_IN=""
WHITE_TCP_OUT="http https"
WHITE_UDP_OUT=""
WHITE_TCP_FORWARD=""
WHITE_UDP_FORWARD=""
# This is an example to whitelist outgoing web traffic:
# WHITE_TCP_OUT="http https"
# This is an example to whitelist the port range 1000-1024:
# WHITE_TCP_OUT="1000:1024"


################################ Whitelist IPs ################################

# New in version 0.9~rc2-12:
# You can specify IP ranges that shall not be checked by MoBlock in a separate
# file. Per default this is /etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p. See the ALLOW_[IN|OUT|FW]
# settings below if you want to use different allowlists for incoming, outgoing
# and forwarded traffic.

# Whitelist either a network name, a hostname (please note that specifying any
# name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea), a
# network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP address.
# (using iptables with the target IPTABLES_TARGET_WHITELISTING)
# The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying the number
# of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent
# to 255.255.255.0.
# Seperate several entries with whitespace (" ")
# This section works only for IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1"
# Do a "blockcontrol restart" when you have changed these settings.

WHITE_IP_IN=""
WHITE_IP_OUT=""
WHITE_IP_FORWARD=""

###################### Remove lines from the blocklist ########################

# Remove lines from the blocklist matching the specified pattern (the search
# pattern is case-insensitive).
# Seperate patterns with a semicolon ";". Be careful: senseless values are also
# accepted.
# Warning for beginners: If you want to whitelist a special IP then use the
# allowlist. If you specify an IP here you will most likely fail.
#
# Do a "blockcontrol reload" when you have changed these settings.

IP_REMOVE=""
# This is an example to remove all lines from the blocklist which contain one
# of the words "google", "yahoo", "altavista", "debian" or "sourceforge":
# IP_REMOVE="google;yahoo;altavista;debian;sourceforge"

######################## Logging and verbosity settings ########################

# You can turn off MoBlock's logging to the logfile by setting DAEMON_LOG=""
# Please note that "test" will not work then.
# The path of the logfiles' directory and the logfiles
LOG_DIR="/var/log"
DAEMON_LOG="$LOG_DIR/$NAME.log"
CONTROL_LOG="$LOG_DIR/$NAME-control.log"
# MoBlock's stat file
STATFILE="/var/log/MoBlock.stats"

# Turn on/off MoBlock's logging to stdout (this isn't supported in
# blockcontrol since moblock is started in the background)
# For blockcontrol's output to STDOUT see the VERBOSITY setting below.
#LOG_STDOUT="0"

# Turn on/off timestamping in MoBlock's logfile
# 0 - No timestamping
# 1 - Timestamping (default)
LOG_TIMESTAMP="1"

# Turn on/off MoBlock's logging to syslog

# 0 - Don't log to syslog (default)
# 1 - Log to syslog
LOG_SYSLOG="0"

# Iptables logging of blocked packets
# Set an iptables target for blocked packets. This will only work if marking
# matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets is on (i.e. REJECT="1").
# The iptables rules will be inserted directly before the iptables rule which
# decides what happens to "marked block" packets.
# Examples:
# "" (empty string): no rule will be inserted (default)
# "LOG --log-level info": blocked packets will be logged to syslog with "info"
#     log level. This allows to find out e.g. the port and to verify if a packet
#     is really blocked and not just "marked block".
LOG_IPTABLES=""

# Set the verbosity of blockcontrol
# This only affects the output to STDOUT by blockcontrol, cron and init.
# This does not affect logging or the output of MoBlock.
# 0 - Output to STDOUT is off (only errors will be reported)
# 1 - Output to STDOUT is on (default)
# 2 - Output to STDOUT is on, but no warning will be shown if an operation is
#     configured not to be executed.
