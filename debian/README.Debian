README.Debian:

Building your own package (Just ignore this, if you use the prebuilt packages):

Caution: debian/rules removes debian/patches/00list and debian/prerm. Instead
00list.default is hardlinked to 00list during package-build.
If the version (as read by dpkg_parsechangelog in the first line of
debian/changelog) contains "hardy" 00list.hardy and prerm.hardy are used
instead.
