Thanks and Greets go to:

- Cade <cade.robinson@gmail.com> for hinting me to the iptables logging to
  syslog and his MoBlock patches (e.g. log the port in moblock.log).

- Jo√£o, for all his work that just started

- Jindrich for his NFBlock

- Morpheus for his original MoBlock

- uljanow - author of iplist (iplist.sourceforge.net). Both moblock (especially
  the marking packets) and blockcontrol (a complete patch for "test") did
  profit from his knowledge and *active* help. Seeing the author of another
  program helping out his "rivals" shows that he got the spirit of opensource.
  Thank you and all the best wishes.
