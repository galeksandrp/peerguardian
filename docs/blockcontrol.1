.TH BLOCKCONTROL 1 "2009-08-21" "Version 1.6" "blockcontrol Manual"

.SH NAME
blockcontrol \- handling IP blockers.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blockcontrol
OPTION
.PP
.B blockcontrol
search PATTERN

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blockcontrol
is designed to do all tasks related to IP blockers (MoBlock or NFBlock):
.IP \(em 3
Start and stop IP block daemon. Or let init do this automatically.
.IP \(em 3
Update your blocklist from online sources and local blocklists. Or let cron do
this automatically on a regular basis. Use backups if anything goes wrong.
.IP \(em 3
Examine your selected blocklists by searching the single blocklists for
keywords.
.IP \(em 3
Remove lines by keyword from the blocklists.
.IP \(em 3
Handle your iptables rules: use a default setup, easily allow all traffic on
specific ports and use an allow list, or add your own sophisticated iptables
rules.
.IP \(em 3
Allow all LAN traffic and the DNS server automatically. If you are on a public
LAN, you probably want to disable this feature.
.IP \(em 3
Check the status and test the IP block daemon.
.IP \(em 3
A watchdog monitors the IP block daemon.
.IP \(em 3
Detects if kernel modules are needed and loads them if necessary.
.IP \(em 3
Set verbosity and logging options.
.IP \(em 3
Provides LSB 3.1 compatible init script.
.IP \(em 3
Daily rotation of the logfiles.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B start
inserts iptables rules, starts the IP block daemon and the watchdog. If the
blocklist configuration changed, rebuilds the master blocklist.
.TP
.B stop
deletes iptables rules and stops the IP block daemon.
.TP
.B start_wd
starts the watchdog. DonÂ´t start blockcontrol.wd directly. Remember that per
default the watchdog gets started automatically on start. The watchdog checks in
regular intervals (per default 5 minutes) if some of the necessary iptables
rules exist and if the daemon is responsive. If one of these tests fails, it
restarts blockcontrol. This is especially useful, if you have other firewall
applications running, because they often mess up the iptables rules, which can
be fixed by restarting blockcontrol. Unfortunately this manual action is often
forgotten.
.TP
.B stop_wd
stops the watchdog.
.TP
.B restart
restarts the IP block daemon.
.TP
.B reload
rebuilds the master blocklist and reloads the IP block daemon if it is running.
.TP
.B update
updates the blocklists, rebuilds the master blocklist and reloads the IP block
daemon.
.TP
.B status
gives the iptables settings and the status of the IP block daemon.
.TP
.B test
does a simple test to check if the IP block daemon is working (pings a random
IP in the blocklist and checks if this IP was logged in the block daemons
logfile and if it answered).
.TP
.B search
Outputs the occurences of a keyword and the names of the single blocklists.
.TP
.B stats
reports MoBlock's statistics.
.TP
.B reset_stats
resets MoBlock's statistics.
.TP
.B show_config
shows the current configuration settings.
.TP
Note for blocklist operations: When the master blocklist is built, missing
single blocklists are downloaded. If any blocklist fails to download, and if
there is no old version available, the operation aborts. If a downloaded
blocklist fails to extract, it is deleted and the operation aborts.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
Blocklists are configured in \fIblocklists.list\fR
(/etc/blockcontrol/blocklists.list).
.P
The allow list is \fIallow.p2p\fR (/etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p). Per default,
the allowlist is used for incoming and outgoing connections. If desired
different allow lists for incoming, outgoing and forward connections may be
used.
.P
The rest is done in \fIblockcontrol.conf\fR
(/etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf). Refer to blockcontrol.defaults
(/usr/lib/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.defaults) for the complete set of possible
configuration variables with comments.

other things about starting/stopping the IP block daemon and updating the
blocklists.
.IP /var/spool/blockcontrol
The single blocklists are downloaded and manipulated in subfolders of this
folder.

.SH WARNING: Users with firewall (iptables rules)
\fBMoBlock\fR (since version 0.9) and NFBlock do not conflict with other
firewalls. But if you use them, you have to take special care to  avoid
severe conflicts. Make sure the following three conditions hold:
.IP \(em 3
The IP block daemon marks non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets.
(The marking feature is on per default.)
.IP \(em 3
Other firewalls do not mark packets.
.IP \(em 3
blockcontrol is started after other firewalls. If other firewalls are started/
reloaded after blockcontrol, then you need to restart blockcontrol again. You
will be fine, if the iptables rules which send traffic to the iptables chains
(blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw) stand before all other
iptables rules which ACCEPT traffic.
.P
.BR "blockcontrol.wd" "(1)"
restarts blockcontrol if it detects any problems.
But the manual restart is still recommended.

.SH NOTES
.PP
By default the IP block daemon will be started at every system boot up and the
blocklists will be updated once a day.

.SH TECHNICAL NOTE
.PP
The IP block daemons check traffic (packets) that is sent to the iptables
NFQUEUE (or the deprecated QUEUE) target. If the necessary support is not built
in the kernel directly, blockcontrol will load the necessary kernel modules.
Up to MoBlock 0.8 packets that do not match the blocklist are ACCEPTed and
packets that match the blocklist are DROPped.
MoBlock (since 0.9) and NFBlock can also MARK packets, so that iptables rules
that match this mark decide what happens with these packets. Per default
marking is on.
Marked packets repeat the hook function (NF_REPEAT). So they are sent back to
the head of the iptables chain again. A packet may only bear one mark, so there
mustn't be any other applications / iptables rules that mark packets. Otherwise
the setup will not work and packets will loop forever.
"Marked block" outgoing packets will be REJECTED, "Marked block" incoming and
forwarded packets will be DROPped. "Marked accept" packets will be ignored, so
other iptables rules decide what happens to them.
