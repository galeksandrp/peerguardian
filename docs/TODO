TODO for blockcontrol and MoBlock debian packaging

blockcontrol:

- send error messages to console and logfile. [João]

- fix debconf to use debian/config again.

- [DISCUSS] Block IPv6 completely because currently only IPv4 is checked?

- [DISCUSS] /usr/sbin/blockcontrol instead of /usr/bin/blockcontrol?

- add blocklist conversion to UTF8 (code already implemented, but not used. Use
  better checks). Wait for blocklist converter by João instead.

- expand test to also use traceroute (with a timeout)

- new manual test to find out in which list and with which entry a blocked IP
  appears. [see also -i option of peerguardnf!]
  Partly solved by patch 90_log.dpatch by cader!

- build_blocklist: disable concatenating blocklists in .p2b (binary) format.
  Abort (?) if several binary lists are used, MoBlock can't cope with this. What
  about nfblock?

- adapt test function for peerguardian .p2b v2 binary format blocklist formats.

- find a new name that suits for MoBlock and NFBlock. Then clear up the mess of
  different file and variables names (and make new ones backwards compatible).
  Possible names: IPGuardian or BlockGuardian. Suggestions and comments are
  welcome!


Requests for upstream:

- [moblock]:  check if blocklists are in the correct format. Or better:
  automatic detection of format + possibility to use several blocklists at once.

- [moblock]: use a real allowlist (instead of the iptables whitelisting)

- [iblocklist.com]: This site renames some filenames. So it is not possible to
  use the upstream URL and the iblocklist.com URL, and avoid the second download
  with wget's timestamp option.

packaging:

- add debtags
