blockcontrol (1.3)

  - New name blockcontrol and new file places. On Debian systems the transition
    is handled automatically (except for the custom iptables scripts)
  - All user configuration is now done in /etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf.
    Not any more in /etc/default/...
  - New option "search": Examine your selected blocklists by searching the
    single blocklists for keywords.

moblock-control (1.2)

  - New handling of blocklists:
    - php redirects are supported now. This allows to use the lists from
      iblocklist.com. All lists are downloaded from there per default now.
    - Since moblock-control 1.1 the default blocklists are by "The Blocklist
      Group" (tbg.iblocklist.com) instead of Bluetack (bluetack.co.uk).
    - The single blocklists are saved in new places now (but still under
      /var/spool/moblock/.
    - The master blocklist (e.g. guarding.p2p) is now saved in
      /var/lib/moblock/ instead of /etc/moblock-control/.
    - Several changes to make sure that the master blocklist exists and reflects
      the configuration. All changes are always applied on "start" now.
    - The (Debian) installation only requires the blocklists (and therefore
      network access) to be available, if the automatic start (init) is
      configured.
  - Per default allow.p2p is not used for forwarded traffic.

moblock-control (1.0)

  - "moblock-control" is a separate package now. So install "moblock" and
    "moblock-control" to have the functionality of the old "moblock" package.
  - the custom iptables scripts /etc/moblock-control/iptables-custom-insert.sh and
    /etc/moblock-control/iptables-custom-remove.sh now are executed for
    IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1", too. This happens after moblock-control's iptables
    commands. Use these scripts e.g. for additional sophisticated whitelisting
    rules. Some examples are given in these files.
    Thanks, Felix Triebel, for the hints about iptables owner module and IPv6.

    IMPORTANT UPDATE WARNING:
    If you are upgrading manually from an older version of moblock-control and
    did not use the custom iptables scripts before: Replace previous versions of
    these files with the current versions, to make sure that the old commands
    from these files are not executed.

moblock (0.9~rc2-12) sid; urgency=low

  - debconf support added: you can now configure MoBlock before you actually
    install it. You can always reconfigure MoBlock with
    "sudo dpkg-reconfigure moblock". Therefore in the Debian packages port 80
    and 443 are whitelisted per default again.

  - You can find out the port a blocked packet was send on. Cader
    <cade.robinson@gmail.com> hinted me to this
    (http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showthread.php?p=116645):
    You just have to use an iptables log-to-syslog rule for marked matched 
    packets. You can then look for the IP in the syslog and read its header.
    The necessary iptables rules will be inserted with the new setting
    LOG_IPTABLES="LOG --log-level info". To allow this also for incoming
    packets I patched the source (previously marking was only possible for
    outgoing and forwarded packets).

    Alternatively you can recompile MoBlock with a patch by Cader and you will
    have the ports logged directly in moblock.log. Download the Debian source
    package and follow the instructions in debian/patches/90_log.dpatch before
    rebuilding the package.

moblock (0.9~rc2-1) sid; urgency=low

  New upstream code (not officially released yet):

  This fixes the merge range bug. Therefore now the same blocklists are used
  again as up to 0.8-32. The blocklist format also changed back to
  "peerguardian .p2p text".

moblock (0.9~rc1-1) sid; urgency=low

  New upstream code (not officially released yet):

  Have a look at README.debian to learn more about the MARKing feature. This
  solves the problems of integration with other firewalls.

  You can also log to syslog now.

moblock (0.8-33) sid; urgency=low

  Changed configuration:

  The names of the conf variables for IP whitelisting have changed.
  The old ones aren't used anymore! Removed udp and tcp options, now always all
  protocols are whitelisted. This should solve many user problems and eases
  configuration. For special needs use custom iptables instead.

  The default blocklist is now www.bluetack.co.uk/config/nipfilter.dat.gz
  because of bug 1818886 (https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail
  &aid=1818886&group_id=162910&atid=825649). So the configured blocklist format
  has changed to ipfilter.dat (-d) instead of peerguardian .p2p text (-p)
  format!

moblock (0.8-26) sid; urgency=low

  Users with kernel 2.6.23 should have a look at 
  https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=12156&group
  _id=2509. The patch from there is already applied.

 -- jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>  Tue, 16 Oct 2007 19:19:19 +0200

moblock (0.8-16) sid; urgency=low

  The package was restructured. A new script moblock-control was
  introduced. There is no more whitelisting per default! If you need
  it then turn it on in /etc/moblock-control/moblock-control.conf.
