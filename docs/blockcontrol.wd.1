.TH BLOCKCONTROL 1 "2009-05-03" "Version 1.4" "blockcontrol Manual"

.SH NAME
blockcontrol.wd \- monitor IP blockers.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blockcontrol.wd
.P
NOTE: blockcontrol.wd is started and stopped automatically with
blockcontrol. It can also be started manually with blockcontrol. DonÂ´t start it
directly.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blockcontrol.wd 
checks in regular intervals (per default 5 minutes) if some of the necessary
iptables rules exist and if the daemon is responsive. If one of these tests
fails, it restarts blockcontrol.

This is especially useful, if you have other firewall applications running,
because they often mess up the iptables rules, which can be fixed by restarting
blockcontrol. Unfortunately this manual action is often forgotten.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configure the watchdog in \fIblockcontrol.conf\fR 
(/etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf). Refer to blockcontrol.defaults
(/usr/lib/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.defaults) for the complete set of possible
configuration variables with comments. You can turn it on/off, specify the check
interval in seconds and specify its path.

.SH FILES
.IP /usr/bin/blockcontrol.wd
