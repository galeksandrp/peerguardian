BUGS of blockcontrol and moblock-deb packages:

################################## Open bugs: ##################################

- blockcontrol can't verify if MoBlock is really started, since MoBlock is
  started in the background.
  A successful start is reported before this is really the case. If MoBlock
  crashes while loading its configuration this will stay unnoticed.
  Would be (partly) solved if MoBlock was a real daemon!
  Additionally (as seen in other init scripts) a timeout of X seconds and then
  a "kill -0" or a "blockcontrol test" is possible.

- User cybergypsy reports that he has to restart MoBlock after 24h, otherwise
  he's "Running out of network connections"

############################# (Major) closed bugs: #############################

- <SOLVED in blockcontrol 1.0-1>
  debconf doesn't work as expected. Debconf runs twice during installation:
  first it asks questions and then it overwrites the answers with the not-yet
  modified configuration files.
  Further the debconf database is not cleared properly on purge.

  Solution: move all stuff from debian/config to debian/postinst.

- <SOLVED in 0.9~rc1-6 and 0.8-40> MoBlock fails to start after install/update
  -
  I frequently have the problem that after updating moblock with aptitude
  moblock was not running (no pid, no process). moblock.log stated:
  "Error opening , aborting...".
  "blockcontrol restart" solves this.

  A test with MoBlock 0.8-39 showed: the process was dead, but the pidfile
  existed. Restarting also solved this...

  Solution:
  On Debian start MoBlock with Debian specific "start-stop-daemon -b"
  and DAEMON_OPTS without "&" instead of the LSB way.

  Have a look for bugs in the init.functions :-/

  Note that blockcontrol can't verify if MoBlock is really started, since
  MoBlock is started in the background. See separate bug of 2008-01-21.
