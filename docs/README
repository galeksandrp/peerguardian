Description:

blockcontrol provides easy ways to interact with MoBlock and do all common
related tasks. Remember this is only a addon for MoBlock, so you still need
MoBlock installed. Alternatively to MoBlockk you may use NFBlock.
MoBlock and NFBlock check internet traffic based on large lists of IP address
ranges in order to protect your privacy. You can get them at
http://moblock.berlios.de and
http://sites.google.com/site/makovick/nfblock-daemon

WARNING: MoBlock may block your complete network/internet access!

MoBlock starts automatically at system boot per default. Some preconfigured
blocklists are updated once a day. Be warned, that MoBlock will not only block
many unwanted IPs, but in most cases running MoBlock will result in a limited
network availability. This includes your own LAN and router, many webpages,
services like eMail, instant messaging or the "weather applet" and your
machine's accessibility from the internet.

There are many configuration options to prevent this. Per default traffic to
your own LAN will always be allowed (whitelisted). This feature is still
experimental. If you are on a public LAN, you probably want to disable this
feature.

WARNING: Users with firewall (iptables rules)
Since version 0.9, MoBlock no longer conflicts with other firewalls. Make sure
the following three conditions hold:
  - MoBlock marks non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist)
    packets. (The marking feature is on per default. It
    will be explained and asked for later.)
  - Other firewalls do not mark packets.
  - MoBlock is started after other firewalls. If other
    firewalls are started/reloaded after MoBlock, then you
    need to restart MoBlock again. You will be fine, if the
    iptables rules which send traffic to MoBlock's iptables
    chains (blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw) stand
    before all other iptables rules which ACCEPT traffic.

Technical note:
MoBlock checks traffic (packets) that is sent to the iptables NFQUEUE (or the
deprecated QUEUE) target. If the necessary support is not built in the kernel
directly, blockcontrol will load the necessary kernel modules.
Up to MoBlock 0.8 packets that do not match the blocklist are ACCEPTed and
packets that match the blocklist are DROPped.
Since MoBlock 0.9 packets can also be MARKed, so that iptables rules that match
this mark decide what happens with these packets. Per default marking is on.
Marked packets repeat the hook function (NF_REPEAT). So they are sent back to
the head of the iptables chain again. A packet may only bear one mark, so there
mustn't be any other applications / iptables rules that mark packets. Otherwise
MoBlock (with marking on) will not work and packets will loop forever.
"Marked block" outgoing packets will be REJECTED, "Marked block" incoming and 
forwarded packets will be DROPped. "Marked accept" packets will be ignored by
MoBlock, so other iptables rules decide what happens to them.

================================================================================

Features:

- Start and stop MoBlock. Or let init do this automatically.
- Update your blocklist from online sources and local blocklists. Or let cron do
  this automatically on a regular basis.
- Remove lines by keyword from the blocklists.
- Handle your iptables rules: use a default setup, easily allow all traffic on
  specific ports and use an allow list, or add your own sophisticated iptables
  rules.
- Allow all LAN traffic automatically. This feature is still experimental. Don't
  use it on public networks.
- Check the status and test MoBlock.
- Detects if kernel modules are needed and loads them if necessary.
- Set verbosity and logging options.
- Provides LSB 3.1 compatible init script.
- Daily rotation of the logfiles.

Usage:

blockcontrol OPTION

================================================================================

Options:

start	inserts iptables rules and starts MoBlock
stop	deletes iptables rules and stops MoBlock
restart	restarts MoBlock
reload	rebuilds the blocklist and reloads MoBlock
update	updates the blocklists and reloads MoBlock
status	gives the iptables settings and the status of the MoBlock daemon
test	simple test to check if MoBlock is working
stats	reports MoBlock's statistics
reset_stats resets MoBlock's statistics
show_config shows the complete configuration

================================================================================

Configuration:

Blocklists are configured in blocklists.list (/etc/blockcontrol/blocklists.list). The
allow list is allow.p2p (/etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p). Per default, the allowlist is
used for incoming and outgoing connections. If desired different allow lists for
incoming, outgoing and forward connections may be used.

The rest is done in "blockcontrol.conf".

blockcontrol first reads its defaults from
defaults (/usr/lib/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.defaults),
then the configuration file blockcontrol.conf (/etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf) and last
default (/etc/default/blockcontrol). The latter overwrites the previous
values. It is recommended to make all user changes in default to ease
updates.

================================================================================

Files:

- blockcontrol (required)
  The shell script blockcontrol. Must be executable.

- blockcontrol.defaults (required)
  Default settings for all variables and pathnames.

- blockcontrol.lib (required)
  Library for blockcontrol, if-up, cron.daily and init.

- blocklists.list (required)
  Lists all blocklists that are used (and downloaded) by blockcontrol for
  use by moblock.

- blockcontrol.conf
  The configuration file for blockcontrol.
  Referenced as CONTROL_CONF in blockcontrol, init, cron.daily and
  moblock-if.up

- default
  The default configuration file for user changes (overwrites values from
  blockcontrol.conf).

- allow.p2p
  Allow List which contains IP ranges that shall be whitelisted.

- if-up
  Gets executed whenever a network interface is brought up to make sure that
  the automatic whitelisting of traffic in the LAN does work. Must be
  executable.

- iptables-custom-insert.sh (optional)
  Script to insert custom iptables rules. This script will be executed on every
  "blockcontrol start" if IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1" or "2" is configured.

- iptables-custom-remove.sh (optional)
  Script to delete custom iptables rules. See above.

- init (optional)
  Init file for starting moblock automatically on every bootup. Must be
  executable.

- cron.daily (optional)
  Cron file for updating the blocklists automatically with cron. Must be
  executable.

- logrotate (optional, configuration file for logrotate)
  Debian place: /etc/logrotate.d/moblock
  assumes logfile in /var/log/blockcontrol.log
  Note: You should add another logrotate for the MoBlock daemon, too! Download
  one from: http://moblock-deb.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/moblock-deb/moblock/mo
  block-0.9~rc2/moblock-0.9~rc2/debian/logrotate

- docs/
  Some documentatation. blockcontrol.1 is a man page.

- debian/
  You don't need this, this is only needed for the Debian packages.

The following directories/files will be created on usage (path examples for
Debian, configurable in blockcontrol.conf):

- /usr/lib/blockcontrol
  The library and hardcoded defaults are placed here.

- /etc/blockcontrol
  The configuration files are placed here.

- /var/lib/moblock
  The master blocklist is saved here.

- /var/spool/moblock + subfolders
  The blocklists are saved here.

- /var/log/

- /var/log/blockcontrol.log + rotated logs
  The logfile of the blockcontrol script. This file contains amongst other
  things about starting/stopping moblock and updating the blocklists.

- /var/log/moblock.log + rotated logs
  The logfile of the moblock binary

- /var/lib/moblock/guarding.p2p + backup or
  /var/lib/moblock/guarding.p2b + backup or
  /var/lib/moblock/ipfilter.dat + backup
  The master blocklist used by moblock depending on the used format.

================================================================================

Installation:

There's a simple Makefile, which will install blockcontrol in fileplaces as
under Debian. This should be the same as defined by the File Hierarchy Standard
(FHS). If this fits for you, simply type

  make install

If you choose other file places, you have to adjust:

- the path to blockcontrol.defaults (CONTROL_DEFAULTS) in blockcontrol, if-up,
  cron.daily and init.
- the path to blockcontrol.conf (CONTROL_CONF) in blockcontrol.defaults
- PATH in blockcontrol.defaults. Either moblock or nfblock have to be installed
  in PATH.
- all other paths in blockcontrol.conf (packagers might also change them in
  blockcontrol.defaults, but this is optional)
- the Makefile

If your system doesn't have the LSB init-funtions (/lib/lsb/init-functions) you
may use those provided in this package.

Note for Fedora 7 and CentOS 5 users (broken LSB init-functions):
http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showpost.php?p=107810&postcount=22


blockcontrol will detect if you have installed moblock or nfblock (in PATH as specified in blockcontrol.defaults)
automatically. Otherwise you can specify this in blockcontrol.conf.
================================================================================

Supported systems:

blockcontrol was written and tested under Debian Lenny. However it should run
under every Linux distribution.

================================================================================

Requirements:

- iptables
- wget (optional, needed for blocklists update)
- /usr/bin/printf (optional, needed during "update" for archive type detection)
- p7zip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .7z)
- unzip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .zip)
- sed, grep, dirname, cat, cd, mv, cp, zcat, md5sum (those should really be on
  every system)
- netfilter kernel support (either as modules or directly built in the kernel)
