---Easy---
**HIGH** Find and fix the auto-expand thing in the Logs tab. Maybe related with the latest Qt.
**HIGH** Confirm and fix the bug which causes some entries in the Logs tab to be unselected when autoscrolling is enabled.
*Improve tooltips, status tips, list/treewidget item behaviour etc.
*Human readable names for the i-blocklist.com blocklists with cryptic URLs.
*Descriptions for each blocklist(How?).
*Create an icon for the application(Who?).
*Completely remove all code for moblock-control's removed "notimestamp" option in blocklists.list.

---Medium---
**HIGH**Fix display of logging blocked IPs (for moblock with the 9x patches from moblock-deb.sourceforge.net). Make sure whitelisting IPs from within mobloquer works.
**HIGH** Introduce support for whitelist files.
*Reduce the configuration file paths the user can manually configure and get most of the data from blockcontrol.conf. Most (?) work already done. The only possible configuration setting (except sudo frontend) should be the path of "blockcontrol.defaults" (/usr/lib/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.defaults). From there get the path of "blockcontrol.conf" (/etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf). Values that are specified in "blockcontrol.conf" overwrite those in "blockcontrol.defaults".
*Allow to whitelist custom ports.
*Improve mobloquer's settings window.
*Fix displayed number of shown ranges (number is NA, if moblock is started with the timestamp option as first option).
