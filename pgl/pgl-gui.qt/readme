Common problems:
	* If mobloquer stops working properly, the first thing you should try to do is delete its configuration file.
	  Just run "rm ~/.config/mobloquer/mobloquer.conf" in a terminal to do so.
	* If you can not connect to the internet after starting moblock, it is probably blocking your LAN/router. 
	  Use the "stop blocking this IP" button to whitelist your local network IP addresses which are being blocked.
	* Launch Mobloquer with the argument --tray if you want it to start minimzed in the tray.
