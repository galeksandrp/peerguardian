pgld (2.0~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * transition to pgld at peerguardian.sourceforge.net
  * removed debian/cron*, debian/init.d and debian/postrm. This is covered by
    pglcmd.
  * removed dl-blocklistpro.pl: blocklistpro is for manual download only. Of
    course we honour the decisions of the blocklist providers. The underlying
    single lists of ipfilter.dat can be downloaded with pglcmd.
  * Debian packaging:
    - depend on debhelper version 6, added debian/compat, removed DH_COMPAT from
      rules
    - bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3.0
    - postinst: do "set -e" separately
    - rules: don't ignore errors on "clean"
    - updated description
    - control: added Uploaders (jre), Bugs (mailto jre), Homepage, Vcs-Browser
      and Vcs-Git fields.

  [Cade Robinson]
  * fixed up logging
  * removed "--no-syslog" and rather use "-s" to enable syslogging
  * removed "--no-dbus" and rather use -d to enable dbus
  * added logging to log file
  * moved closelog (for syslogging) to just before the program exit so we can
    log up to the end of running
  * Changed hit lines to use "||" since descriptions in block file had "|" in
    them.
  * Change order of start up to make sure daemon starts correcly and returns if
    it started correctly
  * Changed to have just a ASCII parse and binary parse
  * changed logrotate to reset stats and reload pgld to open new logfile
