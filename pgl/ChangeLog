pgl 2.0 (WIP)

  * initial release

pgld
  * transition to pgld at peerguardian.sourceforge.net
  * removed debian/cron*, debian/init.d and debian/postrm. This is covered by
    pglcmd.
  * removed dl-blocklistpro.pl: blocklistpro is for manual download only. Of
    course we honour the decisions of the blocklist providers. The underlying
    single lists of ipfilter.dat can be downloaded with pglcmd.
  * Debian packaging:
    - depend on debhelper version 6, added debian/compat, removed DH_COMPAT from
      rules
    - bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3.0
    - postinst: do "set -e" separately
    - rules: don't ignore errors on "clean"
    - updated description
    - control: added Uploaders (jre), Bugs (mailto jre), Homepage, Vcs-Browser
      and Vcs-Git fields.

  [Cade Robinson]
  * fixed up logging
  * removed "--no-syslog" and rather use "-s" to enable syslogging
  * removed "--no-dbus" and rather use -d to enable dbus
  * added logging to log file
  * moved closelog (for syslogging) to just before the program exit so we can
    log up to the end of running
  * Changed hit lines to use "||" since descriptions in block file had "|" in
    them.
  * Change order of start up to make sure daemon starts correcly and returns if
    it started correctly
  * Changed to have just a ASCII parse and binary parse
  * changed logrotate to reset stats and reload pgld to open new logfile

pglcmd
  [jre]
  * transition to pglcmd at peerguardian.sourceforge.net
  * updated description
  * init: added should-start after dbus
  * Email if watchdog detects a problem.
    - Added option WD_MAILTO.
  * removed CUSTOM_DAEMON_OPTS, all pgld options are (and have to) be supported
    by pglcmd directly
  * removed all code for blocklist format specification
    - removed options BLOCKLIST_FORMAT, MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR
    - made MASTER_BLOCKLIST directly configurable, renamed from BLOCKLIST to
      avoid confusion with other use of this variable.
    - removed function test_set_BLOCKLIST
  * build_blocklist: premerge blocklist
  * removed tests for obsolete blockcontrol variables
  * all blocklists in MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR, except those which end in "~",
    are used by pgld. This allows to combine pglcmd's automatic blocklist
    management with manual placed blocklists ("local lists") without any
    configuration hassle.
  * removed "notimestamp" and "locallist" option from blocklists.list
  * force to build master blocklist with "force-update". Otherwise only build,
    if the relevant configuration changed.
  * removed the shebang from pglcmd.main

  [Cade Robinson]
  * added pglcmd options
    - enable/disable dbus (DBUS)
    - enable/disable compression of blocklist (COMPRESS)
    - enable/disable logging verbosity of pgld (...)
    - enable/disable daemon debug mode (...)
  * build_blocklist: added cleanup in the "cat --squeeze-blank" to remove dupes,
    special chars, repeated whitespace, and other chars not needed.
    - this also fixes up p2p lines with multiple colons that was messing up
      parsing in pgld
  * added the ipfilter.dat URL to blocklists.list for reference.
