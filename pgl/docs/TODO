TODO

pgld:

  - fix logging to dbus

  - use a real allowlist (instead of the iptables whitelisting)

  - add search option that gives all single blocklists (not master blocklist)
    with the range and description that contain a specified IP.


pglcmd:

  - Send traffic to several NFQUEUE nums with --queue-balance and run multiple
    pgld instances for these nums. This might help on heavy load.

    Alternatively increasing the default receive/send window seems to fix the
    problem:
        sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=8388608
        sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=8388608

  - watchdog: separate running process check and iptables check. For iptables
    check allow to work without complete pglcmd iptables setup. Probably issue a
    warning about that on wd startup and in the .default-

  - on "stop" remove kernel modules that were inserted by blockcontrol. (see
    dino's synology packaging
    http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showpost.php?p=128371&postcount=20). Probably
    disable this per default, to avoid problems.

  - send error messages to console (STDERR 1>&2) and logfile. [Jo√£o]
    Completely rework the logging part, and check if all messages go where they
    should.
    Add dbus support.

  - fix debconf to use debian/config again.
    This stuff is currently in postinst, because otherwise debconf doesn't work
    as expected: Debconf runs twice during installation: first it asks questions
    and then it overwrites the answers with the not-yet modified configuration
    files.
    Further the debconf database is not cleared properly on purge.

  - expand test to use traceroute (with a timeout)

  - adapt test function for peerguardian .p2b v2 binary format blocklist
    formats.

  - [DISCUSS]: if any blocklist is unavailable, should blockcontrol exit (as it
    does currently, in order to give no false security), or continue but return
    an error (if one list is missing, it's still better to use at least the
    other blocklists).

  - [DISCUSS] Block IPv6 completely because currently only IPv4 is checked?


pgl-gui:

  - add option to temp allow, which inserts the appropriate iptables rules
    directly. (iptables --ctexpire )

  - add whitelisting per IP (normal pglcmd variables), and per IP/port/proto
    (pgl-gui-custom-iptables-insert.sh)

Packaging:

  - Debian:
    - add LOWMEM flavor
    - add debtags

  - make rpms
