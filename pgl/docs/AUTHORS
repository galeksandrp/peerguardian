pgl is an open-source project. We like many authors contributing their work to
this project. This is an attempt to list all authors and contributors.

Authors:
    Cader <cade.robinson@gmail.com>, heavily modified nfblockd, so that it
        became pgld. Also worked on pglcmd and previously much other stuff.
    Jindrich Makovicka <makovick@gmail.com>, wrote original nfblockd, based on
        MoBlock.
    Morpheus <ebutera@users.berlios.de>, created the original MoBlock
    jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>, created pglcmd, based on his
        previous blockcontrol, previously moblock-control. Based on init &
        update script from the forum at methlabs.org (predecessor of
        phoenixlabs.org). Debian packager.
    Dimitris Palyvos-Giannas <jimaras@gmail.com>, created pgl-gui and previously
        mobloquer.

Contributors:
    jpv, initially implemented dbus support in nfblock
    Santiago M. Mola, nfblock build fixes and cleanups
    uljanow <uljanow@users.sourceforge.net>, author of iplist
        (iplist.sourceforge.net). Both moblock (especially the marking feature)
        and blockcontrol (a complete patch for "test") did profit from his
        knowledge and *active* help. Seeing the author of another program
        helping, shows that he got the spirit of opensource. Thank you and all
        the best wishes.
    sloter <laurent at sloter.org>, initial man page for moblock and
        moblock-control, initial moblock-control test function
    lestlest <clessing@users.sourceforge.net>, original Debian packaging, some
        parts of the scripts, moblock logfile rotation patches, moblock pid file
        creation
    JFM, /meth/usr and probably others from the forum at methlabs.org, made the
        first steps for the init & update script

    ... and many more. To be continued ...
