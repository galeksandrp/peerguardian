pgl is an open-source project. We like many authors contributing their work to
this project. This is an attempt to list all authors and contributors.

Authors:
    Cader <cade.robinson@gmail.com>, heavily modified nfblockd, so that it
        became pgld. Also worked on pglcmd and previously much other stuff.
    Jindrich Makovicka <makovick@gmail.com>, wrote original nfblockd, based on
        MoBlock.
    Morpheus <ebutera@users.berlios.de>, created the original MoBlock
    jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>, created pglcmd, based on his
        previous blockcontrol, previously moblock-control. Based on init &
        update script from the forum at methlabs.org (predecessor of
        phoenixlabs.org). Debian packager.
    Dimitris Palyvos-Giannas <jimaras@gmail.com>, created pgl-gui and previously
        mobloquer.

Contributors:
    JFM, /meth/usr and probably others from the forum at methlabs.org, made the
        first steps for the init & update script
    lestlest <clessing@users.sourceforge.net>, original Debian packaging and
        some parts of the scripts
    sloter <laurent at sloter.org>, initial man page for moblock and
        moblock-control, initial moblock-control test function
    uljanow <uljanow@users.sourceforge.net>, author of iplist
        (iplist.sourceforge.net). Both moblock (especially the marking feature)
        and blockcontrol (a complete patch for "test") did profit from his
        knowledge and *active* help. Seeing the author of another program
        helping, shows that he got the spirit of opensource. Thank you and all
        the best wishes.
    Joao, initially implemented dbus support in nfblock

    ... and many more. To be continued ...
