- "reload" doesn't check whether a master blocklist was added.
   pgld reloads successfully even if a blocklist is missing. There should be
   a check to see whether all blocklists pgld was started with, are available.
   Even better would be to check which master blocklists are available and to
   tell pgld to use those blocklists. But I think this requires a restart
   instead of the reload.

- blockcontrol (1.3) if-up:
  check for already whitelisted LAN does not work for all subnetmasks
  -
  The check if a LAN is already whitelisted, will only work for the subnetmasks
  255.255.255.0 and 255.255.0.0. Else a new whitelisting rule will be inserted
  in any case, so there may be multiple identical rules.

- pglcmd only monitors if pgld starts successfully until pgld forks
  (daemonizes). Everything that happens after the fork doesn't get catched.
  - Therefore move as much as possible of the pgld start code before the fork.
    Note that e.g. the pidfile generation has to be done afterwards, because a
    forked process has a new pid. [ DONE ]
  - A possible solution would be for pglcmd to wait some seconds, and then check
    again, but this makes starting slow, so this is not applied.
  - pglcmd.wd partly solves this by doing a restart and notifying the user per
    email and in the logfile.
