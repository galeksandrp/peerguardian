- blockcontrol (1.3) if-up:
  check for already whitelisted LAN does not work for all subnetmasks
  -
  The check if a LAN is already whitelisted, will only work for the subnetmasks
  255.255.255.0 and 255.255.0.0. Else a new whitelisting rule will be inserted
  in any case, so there may be multiple identical rules.

- pglcmd only monitors if pgld starts successfully until pgld forks
  (daemonizes). Everything that happens after the fork doesn't get catched.
  - Therefore move as much as possible of the pgld start code before the fork.
    Note that e.g. the pidfile generation has to be done afterwards, because a
    forked process has a new pid. [ DONE ]
  - A possible solution would be for pglcmd to wait some seconds, and then check
    again, but this makes starting slow, so this is not applied.
  - pglcmd.wd partly solves this by doing a restart and notifying the user per
    email and in the logfile.
