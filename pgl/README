This README is about installation of pgl. For a description and more information
please have a look at pgl/docs/README.




Table of Contents:
==================

1.) Manual installation
2.) Installed files (uninstall)
3.) Build dependencies and runtime environment
4.) Available packages, build scripts and other distribution specific tips




1.) Manual installation
=======================


Step 1: Get the source:
-----------------------
Either get the latest stable release from peerguardian.sourceforge.net and
unpack it.
Or get the current development code:
git clone git://peerguardian.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/peerguardian/peerguardian


Step 2: Base configuration (Makefile)
-------------------------------------
pgl consists of three components: the daemon pgld, the command line interface
pglcmd and the GUI pgl-gui. In the pgl/Makefile you can enable/disable these
components and configure the paths pgl is installed to and uses.

For a slick installation you can turn off dbus support (needed for pgl-gui).
Especially for embedded devices (like router or NAS box) you might set the
LOWMEM option to "yes" to disable storing of textual range descriptions.


Step 3: Install pgl's dependencies
----------------------------------
Install the build dependencies (including the development headers) and runtime
environment for the components (see chapter 4).


Step 4: Compilation and installation
------------------------------------
Issue these commands (they are to go to the correct directory, build, install
and activate the automatic start on system boot):
  cd peerguardian/pgl
  make
  make install
  /usr/lib/lsb/install_initd /etc/init.d/pgl




2.) Installed files (uninstall)
===============================

There is no UNINSTALL routine (yet). But for reference here is a file list as
pgl is installed per default:

pgld:
/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.netfilter.pgl.conf
/usr/lib/pgl/dbus.so
/etc/logrotate.d
/etc/logrotate.d/pgld
/usr/sbin/pgld
/var/log/pgl/

pglcmd:
/etc/cron.daily/pglcmd
/etc/init.d/pgl
  If you activated the init script, first deactivate it with
  /usr/lib/lsb/remove_initd /etc/init.d/pgl
/etc/logrotate.d/pglcmd
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20pglcmd
  or in Debian: /etc/network/if-up.d/pglcmd
/etc/pgl/allow.p2p
/etc/pgl/blocklists.list
/etc/pgl/blocklists.local/
/etc/pgl/pglcmd.conf
/usr/bin/pglcmd
/usr/lib/pgl/pglcmd.defaults
/usr/lib/pgl/pglcmd.lib
/usr/lib/pgl/pglcmd.main
/usr/sbin/pglcmd.wd
/var/lib/pgl/
/var/log/pgl/
/var/spool/pgl/

pgl-gui:
/usr/bin/pgl-gui
/usr/share/applications/pgl-gui.desktop
/usr/share/pixmaps/pgl-gui.png




3.) Build dependencies and runtime environment
==============================================

Build dependencies pgld:
    - nfnetlink development files
    - libnetfilter-queue development files
    - libdbus development files (optional)
    - zlib development files (optional, for loading gz compressed blocklists
        directly)

Build dependencies pgl-gui:
    - Qt4 development files (including Qt4 dbus)

Runtime environment pgld:
    - the above libraries
    - iptables (required)
    - netfilter kernel support (kernel >= 2.6.13 for NFQUEUE support)
      Either as modules or directly built in the kernel. These are the modules
      that are loaded here. Note that "xt_" may be named "ip_" or "ipt_" on
      older systems. The list was compiled with:
        lsmod|grep -E "^x|^nf|^ip"|grep -Ev "^ip6|^ipv6"|sed "s| .*||"|sort
      iptable_filter
      ip_tables
      ipt_REJECT
      nf_conntrack
      nf_conntrack_ipv4
      nf_defrag_ipv4
      nfnetlink
      nfnetlink_queue
      x_tables
      xt_iprange
      xt_mark
      xt_multiport
      xt_NFQUEUE
      xt_state
      xt_tcpudp
    - dbus daemon (optional)

Runtime environment pglcmd:
    - pgld
    - wget (optional, needed for blocklists update)
    - p7zip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .7z)
    - unzip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .zip)
    - start-stop-daemon (optional)
    - awk, sed, grep, basename, dirname, cat, cd, mv, cp, zcat, md5sum, renice,
        pidof (those should really be on every system)
    - /usr/bin/printf (optional, needed during "update" for archive type
        detection)
    - /lib/lsb/init-functions (optional,there's a copy built in)
    - NetworkManager (optional, needed for automatic whitelisting of newly
      brought up network interfaces. Not needed in Debian.)

Runtime environment pgl-gui:
    - pgld
    - pglcmd
    - Qt4




4.) Available packages, build scripts and other distribution specific tips
==========================================================================

pgl was written and tested under Debian Gnu/Linux Squeeze. However it should run
under every Linux system. It is our goal to make life as easy as possible for
users and packagers.

If you are a packager just contact us at forums.phoenixlabs.org or
jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net. We'll gladly give you all possible support,
change the code if feasible and publish your work. Of course you are welcome to
join the project and e.g. commit directly to the git repository.

If you know something missing in this list, please tell us!
