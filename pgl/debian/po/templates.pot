" - pgl marks non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets. (The marking\n"

" - Other firewalls do not mark packets.\n"
" - pgl is started after other firewalls. If other firewalls are\n"

"   be fine, if the iptables rules which send traffic to the iptables chains\n"
"   (pgl_in, pgl_out and pgl_fwd) stand before all other iptables rules "

"   To help you achieve this, pglcmd.wd restarts pgl if it detects any "
"problems.\n"
