pgl (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ jre ]
  * build-depend on debhelper (>= 7.0.50~) for debhelper overrides. Previously
    this was set to debhelper (>= 7.3) for dh_auto_... functions, which were
    (perhaps) needed for the now unused cmake build system.
  * removed cmake hints from README.Debian
  * debian/pglcmd.preinst: don't remove pgl init file on updates
  * debian/pglcmd.postrm: don't remove user files on purge
  * debian/pglcmd.postinst and templates: adapted to iblocklist URL change in
    pglcmd.lib
