Thanks and Greets go to:

- Cade <cade.robinson@gmail.com> for hinting me to the iptables logging to
  syslog and his MoBlock and blockcontrol contributions. E.g. port logging in
  moblock.log.

- Jo√£o, for all his work that just started

- Jindrich for his NFBlock

- Morpheus for his original MoBlock. Parts of his start scripts obviously are
  part of blockcontrol now.

- uljanow - author of iplist (iplist.sourceforge.net). Both moblock (especially
  the marking packets) and blockcontrol (a complete patch for "test") did
  profit from his knowledge and *active* help. Seeing the author of another
  program helping out his "rivals" shows that he got the spirit of opensource.
  Thank you and all the best wishes.

- CyrusJones/daradib - for the Ubuntu wiki based on pelle.k's howto

- clessing/lestlest - who started the moblock-deb.sf.net project and created the
  first packages, now retired.

- pelle.k for his ubuntu howto and the corresponding support, now retired

- quixotic-cynic - for starting the discussion about security risks with
  whitelisting port 80/443 and also for his support at the forums

- sloter <laurent at sloter.org> - for the man page, the test function and his
  support at the forums

- phoenixlabs.org, especially Pepsi.One and fakhir - for providing a place and
  a nice community for discussions and support. Also thx, fakhir, for
  iblocklist.com and the great cooperation!

- /meth/usr, JFM, braindancer and cougar who were at phoenixlabs in the
  beginning of my script writing. Parts of the original scripts were written by
  /meth/usr, JFM and other's of the community at http://forums.phoenixlabs.org
  and methlabs.org. The man page was started by cougar. Although I don't mention
  them in the copyright I don't want them to be forgotten.

- all the people giving support at phoenixlabs.org and ubuntuforums.com

- all the people giving feedback and/or bugreports (especially if they include
  the needed information)
