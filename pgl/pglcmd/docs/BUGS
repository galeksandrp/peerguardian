- Can't switch from moblock to nfblock (and vice versa!?) without rebooting,
  because else nfblock can't bind to NFQUEUE.
  (nfblockd: Error during nfq_bind_pf(): Illegal seek).
  See TODO and nfblock patch.

- Mobloquer only works with start-stop-daemon, but fails with LSB start_daemon.

- blockcontrol (1.3) if-up:
  check for already whitelisted LAN does not work for all subnetmasks
  -
  The check if a LAN is already whitelisted, will only work for the subnetmasks
  255.255.255.0 and 255.255.0.0. Else a new whitelisting rule will be inserted
  in any case, so there may be multiple identical rules.

- pglcmd only monitors if pgld starts successfully until pgld forks
  (daemonizes). Everything that happens after the fork doesn't get catched.
  Therefore move as much as possible of the pgld start code before the fork.
  Note that e.g. the pidfile generation has to be done afterwards, because a
  forked process has a new pid.
  A possible solution would be for pglcmd to wait some seconds, and then check
  again, but this makes starting slow, so this is not applied.
  pglcmd.wd partly solves this by doing a restart and notifying the user per
  email and in the logfile.

- Output to console that should not be there:
  Related to status_of_proc in Jaunty init-functions!? Or redirecting double-
  backgrounded /dev/null traffic to TTY!?

############################# (Major) closed bugs: #############################

- <SOLVED in blockcontrol 1.0-1>
  debconf doesn't work as expected. Debconf runs twice during installation:
  first it asks questions and then it overwrites the answers with the not-yet
  modified configuration files.
  Further the debconf database is not cleared properly on purge.

  Solution: move all stuff from debian/config to debian/postinst.

- <SOLVED in 0.9~rc1-6 and 0.8-40> MoBlock fails to start after install/update
  -
  I frequently have the problem that after updating moblock with aptitude
  moblock was not running (no pid, no process). moblock.log stated:
  "Error opening , aborting...".
  "blockcontrol restart" solves this.

  A test with MoBlock 0.8-39 showed: the process was dead, but the pidfile
  existed. Restarting also solved this...

  Solution:
  On Debian start MoBlock with Debian specific "start-stop-daemon -b"
  and DAEMON_OPTS without "&" instead of the LSB way.

  Have a look for bugs in the init.functions :-/

  Note that blockcontrol can't verify if MoBlock is really started, since
  MoBlock is started in the background. See separate bug of 2008-01-21.
