- blockcontrol (1.3) if-up:
  check for already whitelisted LAN does not work for all subnetmasks
  -
  The check if a LAN is already whitelisted, will only work for the subnetmasks
  255.255.255.0 and 255.255.0.0. Else a new whitelisting rule will be inserted
  in any case, so there may be multiple identical rules.

- pglcmd only monitors if pgld starts successfully until pgld forks
  (daemonizes). Everything that happens after the fork doesn't get catched.
  Therefore move as much as possible of the pgld start code before the fork.
  Note that e.g. the pidfile generation has to be done afterwards, because a
  forked process has a new pid.
  A possible solution would be for pglcmd to wait some seconds, and then check
  again, but this makes starting slow, so this is not applied.
  pglcmd.wd partly solves this by doing a restart and notifying the user per
  email and in the logfile.

- [SOLVED in blockcontrol 1.0-1]
  debconf doesn't work as expected. Debconf runs twice during installation:
  first it asks questions and then it overwrites the answers with the not-yet
  modified configuration files.
  Further the debconf database is not cleared properly on purge.

  Solution: move all stuff from debian/config to debian/postinst.

- [SOLVED upstream in moblock 0.9~rc2-1]
  Merging blocklists results in incomplete IP ranges. Merging range IP1-IP5 with
  range IP3-IP6 resulted in merged range IP1-IP3 instead of IP1-IP6. Therefore
  always check this, if the merge code gets changed!
