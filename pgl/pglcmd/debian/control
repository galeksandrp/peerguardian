Description: Manage pgl
 pglcmd provides easy ways to interact with the pgl daemon and do all common
 related tasks.
 .
 Features:
  - Start and stop pgld. Or let init do this automatically.
  - Update your blocklist from online sources and local blocklists. Or let cron
    do this automatically on a regular basis.
  - Remove lines by keyword from the blocklists.
  - Handle your iptables rules: use a default setup, easily allow all traffic on
    specific ports and use an allow list, or add your own sophisticated iptables
    rules.
  - Automatically make sure the LAN and the DNS server aren't blocked. If you
    are on a public LAN, you probably want to disable this feature.
  - Check the status and test MoBlock.
  - Detects if kernel modules are needed and loads them if necessary.
  - Set verbosity and logging options.
  - Provides LSB 3.1 compatible init script.
  - Daily rotation of the logfiles.
