# Short-Description: PeerGuardian Linux - an IP Blocker
# Description:       PeerGuardian Linux
#   pgl blocks connections from and to hosts, that are listed in a very large
#   blocklist. The blocklist can be in one of the following formats: eMule
#   "ipfilter.dat", "peerguardian .p2p text" or "peerguardian .p2b v2 binary".
#   pgl uses the netfilter xt_NFQUEUE kernel module (available since kernel
#   2.6.13).

# This can happen in early boot stages before local file systems are mounted.
