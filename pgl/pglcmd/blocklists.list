# blocklists.list - lists the remote blocklists that pglcmd handles.

# Place one URL per line for every blocklist.
# Any line which starts with a # (hash) is a comment and is ignored.

# Have a look at /usr/share/doc/pglcmd/README.blocklists.gz for detailed
# information about some available blocklists.

# Instead or additionally to the remote blocklists that are specified here, you
# can put local blocklists in LOCAL_BLOCKLIST_DIR (/etc/pgl/blocklists.local/).
# All blocklists in that directory (except those in subdirectories, or which end
# in "~" or start with ".") are used. They may be in any supported format and
# have to be either unpacked or gzip'ped.

# Do a "pglcmd reload" (or "restart" or "update") when you have edited this
# file.
