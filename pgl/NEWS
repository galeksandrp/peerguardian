pgl 2.3.0 The everybody loves MARKing release

  [jre]
  * removed the (non-default) feature to directly DROP and ACCEPT packets
    (as in MoBlock 0.8), instead of using the (default) MARKing feature.
    Reason:
    ACCEPTing/DROPing packets directly was only needed for kernel/netfilter
    not supporting MARKing. Probably it was also a bit more efficient than
    MARKing.
    But ACCEPTing packets directly breaks other iptables setups - this has
    always been documented, but wasn't known to all users. So in order to
    avoid misconfigurations I decided to drop this feature.
    DROPing directly should not yield any drawbacks, but I decided to also
    remove it in order to make the code simpler.
