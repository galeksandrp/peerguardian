pgl/pgl-gui/INSTALL

It is recommended to install pgl-gui with the pgl/Makefile. This file calls
the pgl/pgl-gui/Makefile. Please have a look at pgl/README.

For testing purposes you may install pgl-gui separately, using a Makefile
created with qmake from pgl-gui.pro. WARNING: This will overwrite the
pgl/pgl-gui/Makefile! So pgl will not be installable afterwards.

Installation instructions:
----

* First of all make sure that all required dependencies are installed (see
  pgl/README).

* Open a terminal and execute the following commands in the directory
  pgl/pgl-gui:
